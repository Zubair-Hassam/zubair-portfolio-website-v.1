# zubair-portfolio-website-v.1
This repo contains the first iteration of a website that will contain links to my future projects so that they may be seen by potential employers.

# Definition of website 
The website build in this project serves the purpose of holding the links that lead to all the areas of importance with regards to myself, coding and what employers might be looking for. 

The structure of the webiste is build in such a way that it entails my instagram link, linkdin link, github link as well as a link to my email if someone wishes to contact me. For aesthetics, there are some images added along each heading to allow for easier understanding. 

# User story and Acceptance Criteria needed to be met 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

# Design Choices 
Upon analysing the website you will find that the layout is such that the text boxes are enclosed with grey background that does NOT reach the ends of the page. This is intentional by design. 

There are also stylised buttons to make the experiance more animated to use.
